## **Details on Bayesian Lasso implementation**     
We implemented the Bayesian Lasso procedure for each model type (additive, interactive, and total human footprint) at each scale using all coefficients and interactions on the block-level portion of the model, with specific variables depending on which model type was being estimated. Similar to Gerber et al. [-@gerber2015] and Stevens and Conway [-@Stevens2019], we searching over 50 potential values of prior variance for the Laplace distribution ranging from 0.1--5 on the log scale, which translated to ~1.1--148 when transformed. We selected the optimal prior for each model type at each scale by comparing models using Watanabe-Akaike Information Criterion [WAIC, @watanabe2010].
