This is Appendix B from the manuscript "Domains of scale in cumulative effects of energy sector development on boreal birds" by @Crosby. submitted to the journal *Landscape Ecology*. The objective of this document is to describe, and demonstrate how to run, the scale integrated occupancy model using Bayesian lasso for variable selection. 

### Software requirements:  

* R for downloading and processing data, and running the models [@RCoreTeam2017], downloadable from https://www.r-project.org/  

* JAGS for estimating model parameters using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) through the use of a Gibbs sampler [@Plummer2013], downloadable from https://mcmc-jags.sourceforge.io/  

* R extension packages: **tidyverse**, **jagsUI**, and **loo**. These can be installed from R using the "install.packages" function  


### Files:  

* **big-grid-point-data.Rdata**: point-level habitat data and bird detections, and survey-level detection variables. 

* **big-grid-block-data.Rdata**: block-level human footprint data. 

These data can be downloaded form the Zenodo repository at:
